# TouchGrass

A free and open source web application for finding, joining and managing groups of people.

## Getting Started

You need to have the following software packages installed for local development:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)

It is _highly_ recommended that you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for development. If so, you will be prompted to install certain extensions.

To start a development server, first create a `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env-example .env
```

There are a few environment variables that need to be filled out:

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a random value, best generated by a command like:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

- `DATABASE_URL` is the URL of the database, which should be something like `postgres://<user>@localhost/<db>`
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` are secret values for using [Discord](https://discord.com) for the application registration
  - Follow [this guide](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/discord) for more information about getting these values
  - Change `/src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` and `/src/env/schema.mjs` to configure NextAuth to use different/additional providers.

Finally, the development server can be started with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

And the main page can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used

TouchGrass is built on the [T3 Stack](https://init.tips), which is the combination of the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

It allows for rapid development with full-stack type safety.
