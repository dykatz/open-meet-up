# Code of Conduct

## General Guidelines

1. Do your best, both in code and communication. Expect others to do the same. Assume good faith and good intentions.
2. Any discussion unrelated to the project belongs elsewhere. This includes—but is not limited to—religion, sex and politics. No soliciting.
3. Understand that this project is free and developed in people's spare times. The developers have no obligation to you or anyone else.
4. Maintain a positive attitude. Do not drag others down when you have a bad day.
5. Do not complain about things you are not actively engaged in improving. Do not trash other projects, companies or communities.
6. Proactively research. Do not ask other people to look things up for you. First consult the code, history, bug tracker or search engine.
7. Be a do-er. Do not waste others' time by suggesting ideas without the will to implement them. Do not be merely an "idea guy". Do not ask about "when" a feature will be implemented.
8. Do not create unnecessary noise. Do not leave comments that an emoji-reaction would sufficiently replace.
9. Avoid sending more notifications to others than necessary. Do not ping when merely referring to someone. Only ping to request immediate attention.
10. Put answers to common questions in the project's documentation. Avoid asking questions privately where they can be forgotten. Log bugs in the bug tracker.
11. Do not try and lawyer your way around these guidelines. Do not look for technicalities in them. Make an effort to understand them in spirit.

## Scope of Application

These guidelines for contributing to the project apply in any forum of communication that is owned by the project.

## Enforcement
